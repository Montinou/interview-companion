## Head-to-Head: Nicolas vs Frederico (on paper)

### Nicolas Lobos WINS on:
- ✅ **Stability**: 6+ years at Radium Rocket (vs 4 companies in 7 years)
- ✅ **Proactivity**: Demonstrated initiative (led migration, built frameworks from scratch)
- ✅ **Communication**: Validated excellent communication in interview
- ✅ **English**: Validated functional professional English (7/10)
- ✅ **Strategic thinking**: Validated risk-based testing, shift-left mindset

### Frederico Reales WINS on (on paper):
- ✅ **CI/CD Match**: Has both GitHub Actions AND Azure DevOps (Nicolas only GitLab)
- ✅ **Performance Testing**: K6 (modern) experience
- ✅ **Mobile**: Appium mobile testing
- ✅ **Education**: Completed engineering degree (vs Nicolas restarting)
- ✅ **International Exposure**: Multiple US clients (CMG, Lithia Motors)

### Tie-Breakers Needed for Frederico:
- 🚨 **English validation**: MUST be validated in live interview (dealbreaker if weak)
- ⚠️ **POM knowledge**: Not mentioned in CV — must probe
- ⚠️ **Job turnover rationale**: Why 4 companies in 7 years?
- ⚠️ **Data-driven testing**: Not mentioned — gap or oversight?

---

## Hiring Matrix

### If ONLY Nicolas is available:
**Decision**: **HIRE** ✅  
**Rationale**: Solid 70/100 score. Main gaps (API automation, GitHub Actions) are learnable. Strong proactivity, communication, and strategic thinking. English validated. Low risk hire.

**Conditions**: None (ready to start)

---

### If ONLY Frederico is available:
**Decision**: **CONDITIONAL HIRE** ⚠️  
**Rationale**: On paper matches JD better (GitHub Actions + Azure DevOps), but **MUST VALIDATE**:
1. English fluency (dealbreaker if below B2)
2. POM knowledge (not mentioned)
3. Job turnover rationale (4 companies in 7 years)

**Conditions**:
- ✅ English >= B2 (validated in interview)
- ✅ POM knowledge confirmed
- ✅ Turnover rationale acceptable

---

### If BOTH are available:
**Decision Criteria**:

| Factor | Weight | Winner |
|--------|--------|--------|
| **English Fluency** | 🔴 Critical | Nicolas (validated 7/10) vs Frederico (TBD) |
| **Proactivity & Initiative** | High | Nicolas (demonstrated) vs Frederico (TBD) |
| **CI/CD Match** | High | Frederico (GH Actions + Azure) vs Nicolas (GitLab only) |
| **Stability** | Medium | Nicolas (6+ years) vs Frederico (4 companies) |
| **Strategic Thinking** | Medium | Nicolas (validated) vs Frederico (TBD) |
| **Performance/Mobile** | Low | Frederico (K6 + Appium) vs Nicolas (neither) |

**Likely Winner**: **Nicolas** (unless Frederico's interview reveals exceptional English + strong proactivity)

**Why**: Nicolas has **validated** strengths. Frederico has **potential** strengths (on paper) but unvalidated. CI/CD gap is learnable. English + proactivity are harder to train.

## Next Steps

1. ✅ **Nicolas Lobos**: Completed, scored 72/100 → **HIRE** decision
2. ⏳ **Frederico Reales**: Cancelled 2026-02-10 → Reschedule if needed
3. ⏳ **Candidate 3**: Scheduled 2026-02-11 → Interview + score
4. 🔄 **Final Decision**: Compare all three after Candidate 3 interview

---

## Decision Framework

```
IF only 1 candidate scores >= 70/100:
    → HIRE that candidate

IF 2+ candidates score >= 70/100:
    → COMPARE:
        1. English fluency (critical)
        2. Proactivity (high weight)
        3. CI/CD match (high weight)
        4. Cultural fit (medium weight)
    → HIRE the best overall fit

IF all candidates score < 70/100:
    → NO HIRE
    → Continue search
```

### For Candidate 3:
- Start with standard interview structure
- Focus on areas where Nicolas/Frederico had gaps
- Compare live against this benchmark
