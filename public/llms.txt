# Interview Companion

> Interview Companion is a free, AI-powered desktop application that acts as a real-time copilot during technical interviews. It provides live transcription, AI analysis, red flag detection, and automated scorecards — completely invisible to the candidate.

## What It Does

- **Real-time transcription**: Sub-second speech-to-text powered by Deepgram, with automatic speaker identification
- **AI analysis**: Each candidate answer is analyzed for technical accuracy, depth, and relevance. Detects red flags (evasiveness, contradictions, vagueness) and green flags (concrete examples, learning mindset)
- **Follow-up suggestions**: AI generates contextual follow-up questions based on what the candidate just said
- **Live scorecard**: Competency radar chart updates in real-time as the interview progresses
- **Multi-language**: Supports English, Spanish, and mixed-language interviews
- **Provider failover**: Automatic failover across multiple STT and LLM providers for zero interruption
