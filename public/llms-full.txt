# Interview Companion — Full Documentation

> Interview Companion is a free, open-source, AI-powered desktop application for real-time technical interview analysis. Built with Tauri, Next.js, and Supabase.

## Product Overview

Interview Companion helps technical interviewers conduct better, fairer interviews by providing real-time AI analysis during live conversations. The system transcribes speech in sub-second latency, analyzes each candidate response for technical accuracy and behavioral signals, suggests follow-up questions, and generates automated competency scorecards.

The application is designed to be completely invisible to the interview candidate. It runs as a native desktop app that captures audio from the interviewer's microphone — no bots join video calls, no extensions are visible, and there is no indication to the candidate that AI analysis is occurring.

## How It Works

1. **Audio Capture**: The Tauri desktop app uses the cpal Rust crate to capture audio from the default system microphone natively on macOS and Windows.

2. **Transcription**: Audio is streamed via WebSocket to Deepgram's nova-3 model for real-time speech-to-text with speaker diarization. If Deepgram is unavailable, the system automatically fails over to AssemblyAI, then Rev.ai.

3. **AI Analysis**: Every 15-20 seconds, accumulated transcript chunks are sent to the AI analysis engine. The AI evaluates:
   - Technical accuracy of the candidate's response
   - Depth and specificity (concrete examples vs. vague generalizations)
   - Red flags: evasiveness, contradictions, blame-shifting, overselling
   - Green flags: concrete examples, learning mindset, self-awareness, strategic thinking
   - Suggested follow-up questions based on context

4. **Dashboard**: Results appear in real-time on the web dashboard, showing:
   - Live transcript with speaker labels
   - AI insights timeline (red flags, green flags, suggestions)
   - Running competency radar chart
   - Interview guide with recommended questions
   - Notes panel for the interviewer

5. **Scorecard**: After the interview, the AI generates a comprehensive scorecard with:
   - Scores across evaluation dimensions (technical, communication, leadership, etc.)
   - Evidence-based strengths and weaknesses (with transcript quotes)
   - Hiring recommendation with justification
   - Executive summary

## Technical Architecture

### Desktop App (Tauri v2)
- **Language**: Rust (backend) + TypeScript/React (frontend webview)
- **Audio**: cpal crate for native microphone access
- **WebSocket**: tokio-tungstenite for STT streaming
- **Size**: ~11MB DMG (macOS universal), ~3-5MB installers (Windows)
- **Platforms**: macOS 12+ (ARM + x86_64), Windows 10+ (x64)

### Web Dashboard (Next.js)
- **Framework**: Next.js 16+ with App Router
- **Auth**: Clerk (organizations, invitation-only)
- **Database**: Supabase (PostgreSQL) with Drizzle ORM
- **Realtime**: Supabase Realtime for live updates
- **Deploy**: Vercel (auto-deploy on git push)

### AI Pipeline
- **Primary LLM**: Kimi (Moonshot AI) — kimi-k2-turbo-preview
- **Fallback LLMs**: Cerebras (Llama 3.3 70B) → NVIDIA (free tier)
- **Primary STT**: Deepgram nova-3 (multichannel, diarization)
- **Fallback STT**: AssemblyAI → Rev.ai

### Infrastructure
- **STT Proxy**: Cloudflare Workers + Durable Objects (WebSocket relay, API key protection)
- **CV Storage**: Cloudflare R2 (S3-compatible, 10GB free)
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions (cross-platform builds, auto-release)

## Features

### Interview Profiles
Reusable, AI-generated interview templates. Describe a role in plain language, and the conversational AI profile builder generates:
- Evaluation dimensions with weights
- Structured interview phases with time allocations
- Tailored questions with expected signals
- Red flags and green flags specific to the role

### CV Analysis
Upload candidate CVs (PDF or Word) before the interview:
- AI extracts experience, tech stack, education, and seniority
- Detects pre-interview flags (timeline inconsistencies, generic content, employment gaps)
- Matches against interview profiles using Jaccard similarity
- Generates suggested questions based on CV content

### Organization Support
- Multi-tenancy with complete data isolation
- Team members share candidates, profiles, and scorecards
- Role-based access (admin, member)
- Invitation-only sign-up

### Candidate Management
- Candidate profiles with interview history
- CV storage and AI analysis
- Cross-interview comparison with scorecard overlay

## Pricing

Interview Companion is free. The application uses free-tier credits from multiple providers:
- Deepgram: ~577 interviews included
- AssemblyAI: ~444 interviews included
- Rev.ai: ~6 interviews included (backup)
- Total: 1,000+ interviews at zero cost

## Privacy and Security

- Audio is processed in real-time and not permanently stored
- All API keys are server-side only (never exposed to clients)
- Organization-level data isolation with row-level security
- Clerk authentication with fail-closed design
- HTTPS everywhere, encrypted WebSocket connections
- No data sharing with third parties
